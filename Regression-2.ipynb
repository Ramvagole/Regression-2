    "Penalizes large errors: RMSE incorporates the squared residuals, which amplifies the impact of larger errors compared to MAE.\n",
    "This can be beneficial when significant errors should be given more importance or when the presence of outliers needs to be addressed.\n",

    "Differentiability: The use of squared residuals in RMSE makes it differentiable, which can be advantageous in optimization algorithms\n",
    "that rely on derivatives, such as gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of RMSE:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitivity to outliers: The squaring of errors in RMSE makes it highly sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "A single extreme outlier can disproportionately inflate the RMSE, potentially misleading the evaluation of the model's overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lack of interpretability: RMSE is not directly interpretable in the same units as the dependent variable, as it involves taking the \n",
    "square root of squared errors. While this doesn't affect the metric's validity, it can make it harder to communicate the practical\n",
    "significance of the RMSE value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of MSE:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical convenience: MSE, like RMSE, utilizes squared residuals, which has mathematical conveniences. \n",
    "It simplifies mathematical operations, such as differentiation and analysis of variance (ANOVA), making it advantageous in \n",
    "certain analytical contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of MSE:\n",

    "Sensitivity to outliers: Similar to RMSE, MSE is highly sensitive to outliers due to the squaring of errors.\n",
    "Outliers can significantly influence the magnitude of the MSE, potentially affecting the overall assessment of the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lack of interpretability: MSE suffers from the same interpretability issue as RMSE since it involves squared errors, making \n",
    "it challenging to convey the practical significance of the MSE value in the original units of the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of MAE:\n",

    "Robustness to outliers: MAE calculates the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values, making it less \n",
    "sensitive to outliers compared to RMSE and MSE. It provides a more robust measure of error when extreme values are present in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretability: Unlike RMSE and MSE, MAE is directly interpretable in the same units as the dependent variable.\n",
    "This makes it easier to communicate the practical implications of the MAE value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of MAE:\n",
    "\n",

    "the magnitude of the errors. This may be a limitation in situations where the magnitude of the errors is important and needs to\n",
    "be taken into account.\n",

    "Non-differentiability: The use of absolute values in MAE makes it non-differentiable at zero. This can be a disadvantage in \n",
    "optimization algorithms that require differentiability, potentially limiting its applicability in certain contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the choice of evaluation metric (RMSE, MSE, or MAE) depends on the specific characteristics of the regression problem, \n",

    "In such cases, more flexible nonlinear models, such as decision trees or neural networks, may be more appropriate.\n",

    "Feature interpretation: Regularization techniques like Ridge and Lasso can shrink or eliminate coefficients associated with less important\n",

    "true underlying complexity of the data. In certain cases, it is essential to retain all the features or consider interactions between them\n",
    "making regularized linear models less suitable.\n",

    "\n",
    "Balance between bias and variance: Ridge regularization generally reduces both bias and variance,\n",
    "while Lasso regularization can introduce more bias due to the elimination of some features. \n",
    "Depending on the balance required for the specific problem, one approach may be preferred over the other.\n",
